  <h1>about me</h1>
  <p>I'm currently a junior studying computer science at Harvard. 
    I'm originally from Taiwan and have lived in Taipei, New York, 
    San Diego, San Jose, Venice, and Cambridge. My favorite sports 
    are those played on frozen water and my favorite 
    candy is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Morinaga-Hi-chew-Fruit-Assorted-Flavors/dp/B003M6HHBE">Hi-chew (ハイチュウ)</a>. I'm interested in doing crazy things
    and can be reached at [wyao @ this domain].
