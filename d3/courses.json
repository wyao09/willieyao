Our discussions cover a range of victim issues, including women, ethnic minorities, historical injustices, refugees, patients, the disabled, and prisoners.","prerequisites":"","notes":"","meetings":"Tu., 2-4","building":"","room":""},{"cat_num":"1815","term":"FALL","bracketed":false,"field":"MED-SCI","number":"300","title":"Conduct of Science","faculty":"374e54e326b7b4e260eaaa185fa5502f","description":"","prerequisites":"","notes":"","meetings":"","building":"","room":""},{"cat_num":"1815","term":"SPRING","bracketed":false,"field":"MED-SCI","number":"300","title":"Conduct of Science","faculty":"374e54e326b7b4e260eaaa185fa5502f","description":"","prerequisites":"","notes":"","meetings":"","building":"","room":""},{"cat_num":"1819","term":"FALL","bracketed":false,"field":"MUSIC","number":"310","title":"Direction of Doctoral Dissertations","faculty":"","description":"","prerequisites":"","notes":"May not be counted toward course requirements for the PhD degree.","meetings":"","building":"","room":""},{"cat_num":"1819","term":"SPRING","bracketed":false,"field":"MUSIC","number":"310","title":"Direction of Doctoral Dissertations","faculty":"","description":"","prerequisites":"","notes":"May not be counted toward course requirements for the PhD degree.","meetings":"","building":"","room":""},{"cat_num":"1822","term":"SPRING","bracketed":false,"field":"ANE","number":"109r","title":"History and Archaeology of the Ancient Near East","faculty":"6fefc1f1508074cfcc6451991a64563d,ff08270181909b0ea5712b554359a56d","description":"Topic for 2010-11: The Assyrians in the Levant","prerequisites":"","notes":"Offered jointly with the Divinity School as 1822.","meetings":"Th., 3-5","building":"","room":""},{"cat_num":"18222","term":"SPRING","bracketed":false,"field":"SOCIOL","number":"98M","title":"Social Class in the United States: Identity, Culture, and Consciousness","faculty":"8b75bdfb735149edc7aa667de334c1c6","description":"This course will review a variety of empirical and theoretical perspectives on social class in the United States with a focus on class-based identities and class consciousness.","prerequisites":"Sociology 97.","notes":"Required of and limited to Sociology concentrators.

Moreover, changes in Earth's climate are raising sea level, changing precipitation patterns, and likely causing an increase in the occurrence of damaging storms, putting more of our global population at risk. In this course we develop an understanding of these natural hazards from an earth science perspective, and examine several case studies to assess their catastrophic impacts. Given our scientific understanding of these phenomena, we examine ways to assess and forecast future natural disasters, and to mitigate the adverse impacts to our societies.

We will grapple with the weaponization of science in the twentieth century and on the one hand, and with clashing accounts of explanation on the other. How does one explain the world of V2 rocket-bombs exploding around London in World War II? Do we learn about the location of future detonations from the ones that come earlier as Pavlov might have had it? Or is the world, at root, inextricably random, with events utterly independent one from the other as Poisson would say? Such reflections on the world--and they extend through identity, love, war, and materiality-- feed back into the very nature of writing itself, and in the final sessions of the seminar, we will turn to literary-philosophical questions such this: How, in the absence of causality and continuity, does narrative ","prerequisites":"","notes":"","meetings":"W., 2-4","building":"Science Center","room":"359"},{"cat_num":"6056","term":"FALL","bracketed":false,"field":"ENG-SCI","number":"394","title":"Microelectronics and VLSI Systems","faculty":"460118378c2936e26df28e59c64b6103","description":"","prerequisites":"","notes":"","meetings":"","building":"","room":""},{"cat_num":"6056","term":"SPRING","bracketed":false,"field":"ENG-SCI","number":"394","title":"Microelectronics and VLSI Systems","faculty":"460118378c2936e26df28e59c64b6103","description":"","prerequisites":"","notes":"","meetings":"","building":"","room":""},{"cat_num":"6057","term":"SPRING","bracketed":false,"field":"PHYSICS","number":"145","title":"Elementary Particle Physics","faculty":"bd066bebcf41d99eaf537fc0eb64d0f1","description":"Introduction to elementary particle physics.

Yiddish was spoken at the time by more Jews than had ever simultaneously spoken any common Jewish language, and when they came in huge numbers to \"the golden land,\" the Lower East Side of New York became a great creative outpost. Newfound freedoms of America inspired new directions in Yiddish literature, poetry, journalism, education, theater and film. Yet those same freedoms also prompted wholesale adoption of English among the second generation. Two parallel streams of culture-including a third in Hebrew-arose within the American Jewish community. Studying this linguistic interaction will help identify its social, political, cultural, and aesthetic tribulations and achievements.","prerequisites":"","notes":"Course assumes no knowledge of Yiddish.

We consider distinctive features of the new genre, exploring novelists' attempts to distinguish their works from non-fiction texts-letters, journals, criminal autobiographies, and travelogues-even as they draw upon them. We also trace novelists' fascination with topics such as sex and gender, slavery and race, money and market culture, sympathy and sensibility, and privacy and personal identity. And we consider eighteenth-century debates (still relevant today) about the dangers and pleasures of novel-reading.","prerequisites":"","notes":"This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the Core area requirement for Literature and Arts A.","meetings":"M., W., at 12","building":"Barker Center","room":"024 (Mcfadden Room)"},{"cat_num":"8687","term":"FALL","bracketed":false,"field":"BIOPHYS","number":"363","title":"Biophysics of Receptor-Ligand Interactions","faculty":"a8ef0f7c3306cc1b15bb773ef064691b","description":"","prerequisites":"","notes":"","meetings":"","building":"","room":""},{"cat_num":"8687","term":"SPRING","bracketed":false,"field":"BIOPHYS","number":"363","title":"Biophysics of Receptor-Ligand Interactions","faculty":"a8ef0f7c3306cc1b15bb773ef064691b","description":"","prerequisites":"","notes":"","meetings":"","building":"","room":""},{"cat_num":"86872","term":"SPRING","bracketed":false,"field":"ENG-SCI","number":"276","title":"Introduction to MicroElectroMechanical System","faculty":"","description":"This course introduces student to the rapidly emerging, multi-disciplinary and exciting field of MicroElectroMechanical Systems ( MEMS).
