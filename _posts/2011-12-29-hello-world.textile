Welcome to my personal site. It's being maintained mostly for self-amusement. I wanted to force myself to organize the things that I work on--I think it's motivating to know that my stuff might be out in the open later. I also wanted to force myself to learn more things and work on more projects, both the boring (eg purchasing this domain/service) and interesting (eg "Jekyll":http://jekyllrb.com). Hopefully you will find something interesting here.
